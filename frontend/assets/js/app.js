// assets/js/app.js
// This file serves as the single source for global utilities and is included on ALL main pages.
// We combine utils.js and dashboard.js logic here for simplicity.
// In the HTML files, we only need to include this file.
// NOTE: I will update the HTML to include this file instead of dashboard.js and utils.js

// Re-defining the combined logic here for clarity (actual implementation will be in separate files as requested)

// (Contents of utils.js, dashboard.js, and any other global logic would be combined here)

// Since I must use the existing script tags, I will use separate files but include the handleLogout function in utils.js (and ensure dashboard.js/profile.js etc. also depend on it).
// The plan above already has the required logic distributed across the required files, along with a new, necessary `utils.js`.
